      <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented script language.
        JavaScript is extremely popula for a variety of reasons. It is a small
        and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to
        take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a
        host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to
        the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
        them.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="">Variable Declaration</a>
          <label for="">
            JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-imagine
            a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable
            holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with
            unique names. These unique names are called identifers. var x;
          </label>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <a href="">Variable Assignment</a>
          <label for="">
            Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup
            can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to
            hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x
            = 10;
          </label>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <a href="">Data Types</a>
          <label for="">
            Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on
            variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
            that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- true or false; null- null
            are nothing; Number- 42 or 3.14; String- "Coding Dojo Rocks!";
            Array- [1, "Coding", 2, "Dojo"]; and Object- {first_name: "Jane",
            last_name: "Doe"}
          </label>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <a href="">Conditionals</a>
          <label for="">
            When you write code, you want to perform different actions for
            different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values
            or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statments
            in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
            statments: if a specified condition is true, do this in our code
            block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first
            condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
          </label>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <a href="">Loops</a>
          <label for="">
            There are many different kinds of loops in every programming
            language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will
            repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a
            mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
            That is a loop!
          </label>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <a href="">Function</a>
          <label for="">
            Functions are an ancaspulation of a code block. When we call our
            function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
            instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk
            from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first
            we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the
            right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a
            ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and
            over again.
